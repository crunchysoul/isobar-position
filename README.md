## Brief about me:
- I’m a person who constantly explore the limits of what’s possible out of intellectual curiosity.
- I’m Also intuitive, imaginative, open-minded and brave to explore new territory and not afraid to be unique.
- All this personal traits are really fit into Isobar’s culture and core, I can feel myself not only fit into, but also able to provide value to company.

## More about my tech journey:
- I only been in Isobar Australia for 4 weeks, which admittedly is short but really fulfilling period for me, I’m really exciting learning from and sharing with others, I have delivered the task that assigned during the internship with many helps from other team mate, I appreciate dearly to everyone’s help.
- I’m genuinely crazy about technologies, Although the position is graduate junior level, I have been working on software related tasks in commercial, academic and hobby level.

### Dev Bootcamp:
- Before this internship, you may already knew that I was on the web dev bootcamp for 6 months, which I learn tremendous amount of relevant knowledge and practical dev skills, which ranging from HTML, CSS, vanilla JavaScript to Ruby on Rails, React, etc modern framework, And created quite three major projects with different skills.
- One bootcamp project that I’m particularly proud of is my portfolio website, it doesn’t sound special, but I archived all the modern website features without using a single Javascript, which illustrates how I care about craftsmanship, as it can be achieve easily using javascript, but I choose to use CSS as a show case of technical confidence, besides, the UI/UX design is very unique.

### Web and Startup:
- During the bootcamp six months, I was also very active while not in class, I self taught Elixir, Phoenix, worked for a friend building website for his startup company.
- Also I did my own startup project, I built and continuing improving a WeChat Miniprogram(It’s a standalone Mobile App inside the WeChat Ecosystem, which is super popular right now among Chinese communities globally). The App is a marketplace focus on the exchange between all Chinese international students here in Australia. All the off class achievements reflects my enthusiasm and passion about tech, besides, I’m very proud that managed to do startup on my spare time. 

### Hackathons:
- When I learning and creating, I also actively attend Hackathons, the last two I went in 2017 is Hack the World, Melbourne, and Future Workplaces, Melbourne. My team created a web service for micro brewer to share receipts and score sponsorship, and a system that monitor employee movement during disastrous events, unfortunately we did not win, but the experiences are very memorable.

### ANU Mathematics and Computer Science: 
- But my technology and development involvement did not started six months ago, before that, I was doing my degree of Mathematics and Computer Science in Australian National University, Canberra. Where I learned not only the foundation of computer programming and varieties of algorithms, and also rigorous mathematical thinking and critical reasoning, they gave me a very solid ground for my future professional development. One instance I’m really product of is, in one of university AI agent tournament(create a AI agency to play Kalaha against others, an African two player chess game) I ranked top 4% among all three hundreds players.

### Computer Science Students Association:
- During the time in ANU, I’m a active member in CSSA, Computer Science Students Association, and was a Common room officer and an International student rep, which serves for all students in computer degree, we constantly organized activities across many technology area, which demonstrates my interpersonal and management skills.

### Financial Engineering, China:
- And before ANU, I worked briefly in one of the most prestige broker house in China, GF Securities. I was in the company headquarter, financial engineering team, which is a small but highly educated team consisted Ph.Ds in mathematics, computer science, and physics, I’m really proud even had the opportunities to learn from them, during the three months time there, my main contribution to the team is preparing both data and academic papers for internal quantitative researches.

### Technology Hobbyist:
- Besides those academic and commercial experiences, I also a technologies hobbyist, in my I love to doing IOT, and assembly related projects,
- For example, I created a two way communication protocol using assembly language on ARM micro-controller, when two ARM micro-controllers connected through GPIO pins, one will serve as server, another will be client, client can using joystick on micro controller send specific command messages and server will feedback with different musics store on it, so it’s basically a midi Spotify service for ARM micro controller.

## Summary:
All above are technology and software dev related experiences and achievements, but I can be more exciting when think about all the possibilities here in Isobar, I humbly understand that I’m at the very beginning of my professional dev careers, and I’m really eager to learn and progress, and contribute to Isobar.

__Here is the takeaways from this rather long rant of myself:__
- I have 6 months experiences in web devs in HTML, CSS, JavaScript, Ruby on Rails, React.
- I learned more off class, Elixir, Phoenix (which is what we using here in Isobar), and I love Elixir.
- I help build a company website for a small startup company.
- I work on my own startup in spare time, a marketplace mobile app in WeChat ecosystem(WeChat is really huge in Chinese communities globally).
- I regularly attends hackathons when I have the opportunities.
- I studied Mathematics and Computer Science, a solid ground for future growth and creative thinking.
- I had ranked top of programming competition. 
- I have involved and served the ANU Computer Science Student Association.
- I have previous experience in financial engineering.
- I’m a technology hobbyist, constantly create gadgets, IOT, ARM micro-controller.
